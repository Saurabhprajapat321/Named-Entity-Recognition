Named entity recognition (NER) helps you easily identify the key elements in a text, like names of people, places, brands, monetary values, and more. 
Extracting the main entities in a text helps sort unstructured data and detect important information, which is crucial if you have to deal with large datasets.

Here in this project i have a named entity recognition model using Long Short Term Memory(LSTMs) which classify the the entities as well as tag them with their part of speech like noun,pronoun,adjective etc

 i have verified the result obtained through the model using SpaCy Library (provide built-in NER function to classify the entities)
